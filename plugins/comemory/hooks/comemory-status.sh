# SessionStart hook — publish this project's comemory memory count for the statusline.

# Counts memories for the MAIN-repo key on each session start (startup/resume/
# clear/compact) and writes a small marker
# the statusline reads to render a [COMEMORY:N] badge. The key is derived from
# git-common-dir so worktrees share the main repo's memory scope (a bare worktree
# toplevel basename would mis-scope to the worktree name and read 0).
#
# Bounded and non-fatal: a missing, slow, or failing comemory never stalls session
# start and simply leaves no marker (the badge is then omitted).
