# Pre-tool check: enforce --repo scope on raw `comemory` CLI invocations.
#
# Without --repo, `comemory search` / `save` / `context` / `search-code` mix
# results across every repo in the local comemory store — wasted tokens at
# best, wrong-repo answers at worst. The `skills/agent-memory/scripts/comemory.sh
# <subcmd>` wrapper (resolved relative to this module — skills/ is a
# sibling of hooks/ inside the plugin root, in-repo and installed alike)
# auto-scopes; this module pushes the agent toward that path by denying
# unscoped raw calls.
#
# Subcommands that require scoping: search, save, context, search-code,
# index-code, graph. `context` is a real comemory verb (a repo-scoped headline
# lookup) and so is guarded here even though the comemory.sh wrapper does not
# dispatch it — a raw `comemory context` without --repo would still leak across
# repos. index-code/graph accept --repo (the wrapper auto-injects it), so a raw
# unscoped call carries the same leak hazard.
# The retrieval-loop verbs (mine, tune, eval, prune, gc, rebuild, feedback)
# and list/doctor/stats/serve/--help/--version are intentionally global —
# comemory accepts no --repo on them.
#
# Always allowed: wrapper calls (`comemory.sh …` adds --repo itself), and
# raw calls that already include --repo. comemory has no `-p` short flag and no
# repo env var, so --repo is the only scope signal.
